The First Lady of the United States is the hostess of the White House, advisor to the President, and often plays a role in social activism. The position is traditionally held by the wife of the President of the United States, concurrent with his term of office. If the President is not married, or if the President's wife is unable to act as First Lady, then the President asks a female relative or friend to fill the role. The current First Lady is Michelle Obama who, as a result of the re-election of Barack Obama on November 6, 2012, is scheduled to serve until January 20, 2017
